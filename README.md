# Probabilistic-Graphical-Models
In this project, we first convert a Bayesian Model to a Moral Graph, the Moral Graph to a Triangulation Graph and the Triangulation Graph to a Junction Tree. We then perform inference using Variable Elimination and Belief Propagation. Finally, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to confirm the joint probability.
